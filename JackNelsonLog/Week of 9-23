Last week I created a demo file that allows a user to upload an image, and the image is then made the background of the page.
As well, I created a file for the Subsystem Intro Project, and got it working correctly.
This week, I plan to finish up the FSR and ICD, and also decide on a plan for the visual design of the WinForms application with Nate.
This will also include a 'rough draft' idea of how we plan to graphically design the application.
