For last week, I formulated a rough plan for creating a data folder pipeline to train the 5 feature CNN
I wrote a file searching python script to help me snip the grass images using their bounding boxes
Then I learned more about implementing custom datasets using tensorflow
My goal for this week is to work on the subsystem intro project, fsr, and create the 5 custom training sets for each grass/feature type
